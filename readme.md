## Project Overview

This project documents my journey in learning, building, and iterating on LLM applications. The focus is on developing text-to-text interactions initially, with plans to expand to image and sound capabilities in the future.

## Roadmap

1. **Model Flexibility:**  
   The first step is selecting a group API provider that allows seamless switching between different models. This will enable easy experimentation and testing of various models.

2. **Provider Choice:**  
   We have chosen to work with [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (with [Together.ai](https://together.ai) as an alternative).  
   > **Note:** OpenRouter has occasionally been known to censor its output. However, in the absence of a better alternative, we will continue using it for now.
