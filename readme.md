## Project Overview

This project documents my journey in learning, building, and iterating on LLM applications. The focus is on developing text-to-text interactions initially, with plans to expand to image and sound capabilities in the future.

## Roadmap

1. **Model Flexibility:**  
   The first step is selecting a group API provider that allows seamless switching between different models. This will enable easy experimentation and testing of various models.

2. **Provider Choice:**  
   We have chosen to work with [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (with [Together.ai](https://together.ai) as an alternative).  
   > **Note:** OpenRouter has occasionally been known to censor its output. However, in the absence of a better alternative, we will continue using it for now.
3. **Pricing:**  
   We have chosen to work with [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) (with [Together.ai](https://together.ai) as an alternative). 
The React component I created isn't easily copiable into a README.md file since it's interactive. Let me create a simpler markdown table version that you can directly copy into your README.md file:

## Learning LLM Building: Tips

1. **Start Small**: Begin with smaller models (1B-7B parameters) as they require less computational resources.
2. **Open Source Focus**: Prioritize open source models which have available architecture descriptions and weights.
3. **Study Architecture Families**: The Llama, Mistral, and Phi families offer excellent learning opportunities with well-documented architectures.
4. **Mixture of Experts (MoE)**: For advanced study, look at models with the MoE feature which allows for larger effective parameter counts.
5. **Consider Base Models**: Base models (before instruction tuning) are often better for understanding core architecture.
6. **Key Papers**: Look for the technical papers associated with these models for architecture details.
7. **GitHub Repositories**: Check the model's GitHub repository for implementation code, configuration files, and training scripts.
